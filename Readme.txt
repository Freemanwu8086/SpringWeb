This is a learning projece from suns of baizhiedu, thanks this teacher very much!(催更SpringMVC以及Spring boot!)
Now it can do a little job: register a pair of Username and Password into the database.
The Whole project is based on Spring+Struts2+Mybatis.
OS:Linux(Ubuntu 20.4)
Mysql:8.0.23
Sql file now is in the root src.
And it's for my personal learning, if you like it, you can find suns of baizhiedu to learn more about it! So DO NOT use it to do something which is NOT for Study!
Thank you！
